### Data Structures

* http://guigrpa.github.io/timm/
* [lazy.js](https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js)

### Algebraic Data Types

Types formed by composing other types.

* [FantasyLand](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) - :rainbow: Not a library but a specification of the Monad laws for libraries to follow.
* [daggy](https://github.com/puffnfresh/daggy) - Library for creating tagged constructors.
* [Sanctuary](https://github.com/plaid/sanctuary) - Sanctuary makes it possible to write safe code without null checks.
* [ramda-fantasy](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-fantasy) – Fantasy-Land compatible types for easy integration with Ramda.js.
* [monet.js](http://cwmyers.github.io/monet.js/) - A library that assists functional programming by providing a rich set of Monads and other useful functions.

### Lenses
* [lenses](https://github.com/DrBoolean/lenses) - Composable kmett style lenses
* [optics](https://github.com/flunc/optics) - profunctor optics (Lens, Prism, iso)
* [ramda-lens](https://github.com/ramda/ramda-lens) - :ram: :mag_right: Lens library built on ramda
* [fantasy-lenses](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-lenses) - Composable, immutable getters and setters. (profunctor lenses WIP)
* [nanoscope](https://github.com/5outh/nanoscope) - Lenses with dotty support
